        The main change is <CelestialConduit />, an extra active healing CD on 1.5 min CD. This is a
        powerful cooldown. See{' '}
        <Link href={`#${healingCooldownsTitle}`}>{healingCooldownsTitle}</Link> above for more
        details on how to use it to heal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <CelestialConduit /> doubles up as a defensive when you run <JadeSanctuary />. Since{' '}
        <FortifyingBrew /> and <DiffuseMagic /> are also 1.5 min CD, you can rotate this alongside
        them on 30 second boss mechanics which are quite common, such as CoTâ€™s last boss.
      </p>
      <p>
        <StrengthOfTheBlackOx /> gives you <EnvelopingMist /> procs that create a small shield on
        your party. This actually does pretty good HPS, so use these procs on cooldown whenever you
        need to do group healing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <HeartOfTheJadeSerpent /> gives you a bunch of CDR, mainly meaning you will get more{' '}
        <ThunderFocusTea />s and more <LifeCocoon />s
      </p>
      <p>
        <AugustDynasty /> gives you a powerful single target <Vivify /> after a <JadefireStomp />.
